# Liquid Glass

Quick and simple Liquid Glass material in CSS. The background distortion around the edges only works on Blink-based browsers, while the different blend modes only work on WebKit-based browsers. Everything else was recreated based on Appleâ€™s Figma template. Switching between light and dark theme makes Liquid Glass behave differently. Drag the buttons below to see how it works.
